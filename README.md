# electrocardiogram-system-using-stm32f103
This is an electrocardiogram acquisition device using an ADS1292 Texa instrument IC interfaced with an SMT32F103 microcontroller. 
All the algorithms including, the heart rate calculation, the digital filters were done on MATLAB, then transferred to STM32 microcontroller. The data was also sent to an android app to display the waveform in real-time.
A comparison of the heart rate of the device was done against the standard device heart rate . The error rate was less than 1%.
The short video illustrate the system running without transfering the data to the mobile phone.
